/*

 * Variables declared with let and const are block-scoped and are also

 *
 * It is generally recommended to use let and const instead of var to
 * avoid confusion related to variable scope and hoisting.
 *
 * Declaring variables with let and const at the top of their scope
 * improves code clarity and helps prevent accidental re-declarations
 * or accessing variables before initialization.
