/*
 * To address the issue of comparing floating-point numbers for equality, a
 * common approach is to use a small epsilon value to account for the potential
 * rounding errors.
 *
 * The areFloatsEqual function compares two floating-point numbers by checking
 * if their absolute difference is less than a small epsilon value (0.000001 in
 * this example).
 *
 * This approach provides a more reliable way to compare floating-point numbers
 * for approximate equality, taking into account the inherent limitations of
 * floating-point arithmetic.
